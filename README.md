# Istanbul-Arcade-Case
This repository exists to upload the Coursera Data Science final capstone project. The study case proposed here is the arcade business (play station cafe) in Istanbul.

## Introduction:
The game sector, part of the broader entertainment industry, reach everyday new user and possible buyers. This continuous prospect of growth is at the base of the creation of gaming echange traded funds and an increasing trust in the solidity of such business. Istanbuls yet offer a different perspective with respect to the rich-countries behaviour: most of the gamers don't own a console, rather they visit Arcade/playstation caf√®. This place can be defined as a location that for a mager payment (low-cost) offers the experiene of playing with friends, online or alone any game. This is often connected to the consumption of food, beverages and related merhindise. Yet, what is the rough dimension of such cafes in istanbul? How many players do it involve? What are the earning prospects?

## Data
By using the data from Foursquare and the proposed geographical representation of them it is possible to research the above mentioned business problem and offer an insight for possible new arcades, new business partnerships, or the offering of a service such as restock of beverages/console parts and gadjets in a liverly and highly populated city as Istanbul. The analysis of the phenomenon could also lead to the idea of opening an arcade chain in location with similar geographical, economical and social conditions/characteristics. In fact, while we talk a new chain opened in italy near my home!
